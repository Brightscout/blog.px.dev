To make the profile unique, you can use good MySpace layouts. This will make a world of a difference to the profile. Imagine that someone visits your profile, and they find it without any good information or pictures. They would not spend another minute looking at it, and you will quickly lose your reputation.

You will also lose the chance to make a whole new bunch of friends. You cannot expect them to take a second look at your profile. Thus before you lose the chance to make new friends, you should customize the profile as best as you can. You can choose from a great variety, as there are plenty of sites, which are dedicated to MySpace layouts.
